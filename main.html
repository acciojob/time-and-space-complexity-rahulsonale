	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It provides a way to analyze and compare the efficiency and performance of different algorithms, making it easier to determine which one is more efficient, particularly as the size of the input data changes. Time complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time in relation to its input size.</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) describes an algorithm or data structure where the amount of memory used grows linearly with the size of the input, denoted as 'n'. This is also known as linear space complexity.</p>
